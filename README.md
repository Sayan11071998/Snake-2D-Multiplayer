# ðŸš€ Project Milestone: Snake-2D Multiplayer Game

**Snake-2D Multiplayer** is a modern Unity reimagining of the classic Snake gameâ€”with a competitive twist. Designed for two players, this project blends retro gameplay with new mechanics, custom animations, and real-time multiplayer systems. Built entirely in Unity using C# and the Rigidbody2D system, the game pushes familiar mechanics into fresh territory.

## Game Features

- **Custom Snake Movement**  
  Smooth directional control using Rigidbody2D in Kinematic mode for responsive, fluid movement.

- **Two-Player Input System**  
  Simultaneous input logic allows two players to compete head-to-head in real time.

- **Classic Snake Mechanics**  
  Integrated the timeless "eat to grow" system with modern enhancements.

- **Snake Prefabs & Animations**  
  Directional flipping and rotation bring life to every movement and reduce animation jitter.

- **Snake Type Customization**  
  Defined two snake types using Enums for unique colors, identifiers, and movement behaviors.

- **Power-Ups and Visual Effects**  
  Added power-up items (e.g., immunity, speed boost) with animated feedback and VFX triggers.

- **Multiplayer Penalty System**  
  Body collisions reduce score; head-on collisions result in instant elimination.

- **Boundary Looping**  
  Screen edge teleportation enables continuous motion and surprise strategic comebacks.

- **Score and Health UI**  
  Real-time tracking of each player's score and health with intuitive UI layout.

- **Game Menus and Scene Control**  
  Functional main menu, in-game interface, and Game Over screen for full-game navigation.

- **Audio & Singleton Management**  
  Singleton pattern manages background music, SFX, and global game state efficiently.

  Improved custom scripting skills, especially in input handling, object pooling, and UI logic.

- **Custom Input & Movement Systems**  
  Developed real-time controls with smooth, reliable movement for both players.

- **UI/UX Design**  
  Emphasized clarity and usability in score tracking and player feedback systems.

- **Code Architecture**  
  Applied Singleton and modular prefab design for scalability and maintenance.

- **Gameplay Design & Feedback Loops**  
  Enhanced the player experience with layered systems like power-ups and penalties.

- **Multiplayer Interaction**  
  Gained practical insight into balancing fairness and competitiveness in multiplayer logic.

## Conclusion

**Snake-2D Multiplayer** challenged and sharpened my skills across game mechanics, UI, and systems architecture. It brought a nostalgic concept into a new space with engaging features and real-time interaction. Iâ€™m excited to continue building on these experiences in future game development projects.

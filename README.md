# ðŸš€ Project Milestone: Snake-2D Multiplayer Game

**Snake-2D Multiplayer** is a modern Unity reimagining of the classic Snake gameâ€”with a competitive twist. Designed for two players, this project blends retro gameplay with new mechanics, custom animations, and real-time multiplayer systems. Built entirely in Unity using C# and the Rigidbody2D system, the game pushes familiar mechanics into fresh territory.

## Game Features

### Custom Snake Movement  
Implemented smooth directional controls using Rigidbody2D in Kinematic mode, ensuring responsive and fluid movement in all directions.

### Two-Player Input System  
Developed a simultaneous input system for two players, allowing for competitive multiplayer gameplay on a shared screen.

### Classic Snake Mechanics  
Preserved the traditional "eat to grow" mechanic while adapting it for modern visuals and real-time competition.

### Snake Prefabs & Animations  
Created modular snake prefabs that dynamically rotate and flip based on input, enhancing visual feedback and improving animation flow.

### Snake Type Customization  
Used enumerations to define unique snake types with distinct colors and movement patterns, helping differentiate players during fast-paced gameplay.

### Power-Ups and Visual Effects  
Introduced power-up mechanics such as temporary immunity and speed boosts, complete with visual indicators to keep players informed mid-match.

### Multiplayer Penalty System  
Added body and head-to-head collision penalties. Score reductions and player eliminations introduce stakes and encourage tactical play.

### Boundary Looping  
Implemented screen-wrapping to allow snakes to seamlessly travel across screen edges, maintaining tension and unpredictability in gameplay.

### Score and Health UI  
Built a dynamic UI system to track player health and scores in real-time, supporting transparency and competition.

### Game Menus and Scene Control  
Designed and programmed a main menu, in-game UI, and Game Over screens to manage the full player experience from start to finish.

### Audio & Singleton Management  
Applied the Singleton pattern to manage background music, sound effects, and global game states, improving performance and code organization.

## Key Learnings

- **Unity & C# Proficiency**  
  Deepened understanding of Unity scripting, particularly in handling Rigidbody2D, UI systems, and event-driven interactions.

- **Custom Input & Movement Systems**  
  Built custom logic for precise player input handling, testing critical thinking around object control and collision responses.

- **UI/UX Design**  
  Focused on delivering a clean and informative user interface to enhance the multiplayer experience.

- **Code Architecture**  
  Leveraged design patterns like Singleton to maintain clean, reusable, and efficient code structures across gameplay systems.

- **Gameplay Design & Feedback Loops**  
  Explored how power-ups, penalties, and screen-looping mechanics can reshape the feel of a classic game and increase replayability.

- **Multiplayer Interaction**  
  Designed and tested real-time multiplayer mechanics, balancing fun and fairness through game logic and collision rules.

## Conclusion

**Snake-2D Multiplayer** was an insightful and rewarding project that merged nostalgic gameplay with modern design principles. It challenged my scripting skills, tested my understanding of multiplayer dynamics, and emphasized the importance of user experience. Iâ€™m excited to take these lessons forward into future Unity projects.

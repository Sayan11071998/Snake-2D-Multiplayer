# ***🚀 Project Milestone: Snake-2D Multiplayer Game! 🚀***

Hey everyone!
I’m super excited to share my latest Unity project—a 2D multiplayer twist on the classic Snake game! 🐍🎮 From reimagining retro fun to diving head-first into real-time multiplayer chaos, this project took me on a deep dive into game mechanics, networking, and everything in between. And let’s just say, my respect for classic game developers is now through the roof!

### **✨ Highlights of Snake-2D Multiplayer:**
- **🎮 Custom Snake Movement:** Developed smooth snake controls using Rigidbody2D in Kinematic mode—because who knew a simple snake would need so much precision? (Hint: not me at first!)
- **👥 Two-Player Input System:** Built a dual-input system so both players can compete head-to-head, simultaneously. Twice the fun, and twice the bugs… initially.
- **🍏 Classic Snake Mechanics:** Integrated the classic “grow the snake by eating” mechanic—because some things should never change.
- **🐍 Snake Prefabs and Animations:** Created snake prefabs that dynamically flip based on input. Now each directional change is a tiny masterpiece (or at least, a slightly-less-jittery animation).
- **🎨 Snake Type Customization:** Used Enums to manage two snake types, enabling unique colors and movement patterns—because nobody wants to mix up which snake is theirs mid-game!
- **⚡ Power-Ups and Special Effects:** Implemented power-up items like health immunity and speed boosts, complete with visual effects, so you know when the fun is about to start.
- **💥 Multiplayer Penalty System:** Added a penalty system—because friendly competition is overrated. Body collisions reduce your score, and head-to-head collisions… well, you’re out!
- **🌐 Boundary Looping:** Made the snake magically teleport across boundaries, keeping the game interesting. Turns out, it’s hilarious to watch a snake pop up on the other side unexpectedly.
- **📊 Score and Health UI:** Built a real-time UI system to track each player’s stats, because no rivalry is complete without a scoreboard.
- **📋 Game Menus and Control:** Created polished Main Menu and Game Over scenes, where you can reflect on your amazing gameplay decisions.
- **🎶 Audio and Game Management with Singleton:** Used the Singleton pattern to manage background music and sound effects—because silence is only golden until it’s awkward.

🌟 Takeaways and Growth:
- **📈 Unity and C# Skills:** Improved my C# programming, especially in custom scripting. Now I officially know more about scripting snakes than I ever thought I would.
- **🧠 Problem-Solving Skills:** Customizing snake movement and creating dual player controls tested my logic and scripting—who knew guiding a snake around could be such a brain teaser?
- **🗃️ Efficient Code Management:** Mastered the Singleton pattern to keep scripts organized and my sanity intact (mostly).
- **👥 User-Centered Design:** Creating a user-friendly UI with score and health tracking taught me how critical feedback is for player experience. Gotta love the “friendly” competition!
- **🎮 Creative Gameplay Mechanics:** Adding power-ups, penalties, and that boundary-looping twist brought new excitement to classic gameplay—who knew teleporting snakes could be so fun?
- **🤝 Hands-On with Multiplayer Systems:** Developing penalty systems and head-to-head collisions was an eye-opener into multiplayer game design—and yes, it’s just as intense as it sounds.

This project taught me invaluable lessons in game mechanics, Unity UI, and multiplayer interactions. Big thanks to everyone who gave feedback and playtested along the way! Looking forward to bringing more games (and probably some quirky bugs) to life soon. 🕹️
